So apparently, I am being judgmental and ill-informed. After all a vast majority thinks otherwise. Well, here are facts:

* Contrary to popular belief, the CBI did NOT EVER investigate the riots in their _entirety_. Don’t take my word. Look it up.
In the best bakery case, 100+ people ganged up and killed 14 people (3 of who were hindus). all of the 21 accused were set free by the Gujarat fast track court. SET FREE. The supreme court ordered a retrial _outside_ Gujarat. And accused the government of judicial failures. Which the government admitted as well! In subsequent trial, people went to jail. And yet there is a clean chit to the govt!

* The ONLY investigation RIGHT after the riots was the shah-nanavati commission in 2003. Which declared the state govt innocent in a couple of months, WITHOUT HEARING ANY testimony from anyone.

* It did nothing till about 2008 when Shah part of the commission went to hell. After him, Akshay Mehta was appointed to this commission. The same guy who bailed out Babu Bajrangi (exemplary citizen). Till date, the commission after 20 extensions has NOT finished. It need not ever. I think if it does, they will ask Narendra bhai to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. And an unconditional apology from the 2000+ who died, for ever been born in his hallowed state. In writing.

* The ONLY OTHER investigation was ordered for by the Supreme Court IN - wait for it - 2008. 6 years after. For investigation into, again, 9 _specific_ cases. ONLY 6 of which are closed. 3 are still pending. There have been several complaints on deaf ears on evidence ignored by the SIT. But despite over a decade of delayed (& denied) justice, the honorable supreme court had to rush the “clean chit” to Modi, just before the elections. For all the irreparable loss from the riots, thousands of families were destroyed, living/dead for ever. All we have is a clean-chit on our hands. If this doesn’t make your organs churn, well, good for you. Achhe din aane waale hain.

* Haren Pandya: Home minister in Modi’s _OWN_ government. Murdered in 2003. Not 1 person goes to jail, all accused set free. He had opposed parading Godhra dead bodies in Ahmedabad. May have had a change of heart after riots. Well such hearts need to stop beating. Too bad for him. Could have been the Home minister of India now.

* Sanjiv Bhatt: IIT grad, IPS. He has provided evidence incriminating Modi. to the commission/courts/president of india. He is suspended  (for neglecting duty - wow, when has a govt officer had that), arrested, out on bail. His family is under threat. But our PM has a clean chit.

* Fake encounters. Several. Sohrabuddin, Ishrat Jahan.. The DIG, Vanzara is in jail. since 2007. There is concrete evidence that Amit Shah, home minister made 331 calls to Vanzara around the occurrences of these fake encounters. Heck, Amit Shah also went to jail for the sohrabuddin case. He is out on bail. CBI appealed for his bail cancelation, saying he could interfere with investigations. The nice judge, ordered Amit Shah to not enter Gujarat. As if one can only influence that way. And sure enough, now, the CBI has given a, you guessed it right, a clean chit to Amit Shah. and btw, the DIG in jail recently resigned, saying he was just following orders, if not abundantly clear. If you are confused, this is the same Amit Shah, considered Modi’s right hand man. Credited with winning UP for modi. among other less charitable things.

* It takes a special degree of ass-holery to parade the dead bodies from Godhra in Ahmedabad, make CDs of them and distribute, and after over 2000 families have been irreparably destroyed, several thousands in relief camps, systematic targeting of muslim owned businesses, GO ON A FRIGGING “gaurav yaatra”. What human does that? Nothing close happened in any riot ever, 1984 included. Where he exhorts all across Gujarat how he & Gujaratis are being victimized!!! And then the icing on the shit - forced elections prematurely. Within 4 months of the riots. While over a 100,000 of his frigging Gujarati bhais and bhens (BUT, muslims) were hurting, real bad. And several institutions pleaded with him to not do so. This is premium rare platinum grade ass-holery. The only unit in stock bought by India.

* He hasn’t once vocally expressed regret for at least - the lives lost. The closest he got was when he equated this to how one would feel when their cars crushed dogs. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE? SERIOUSLY, No one better than this bag of shit for PM?
I really don’t care for the snoop-gate. For all I care, Narendra bhai may continue to spread his love among his bhens. It is just that people don’t seem to question the atrocious logic offered by the father in his request to stop investigation into snoopgate. Which btw, would still be criminal. Govt cannot just snoop on people., for whatever logic.

So, well, I don’t give a shit to the clean chit to modi. Sorry - I actually do. They are cheap at walmart, and come in rolls.

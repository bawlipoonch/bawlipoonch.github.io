<i>Pyar kiya to darna kya?</i> embodies the spirit of bravery and defiance in love. What could be better song to write about on Valentine's day. Mood in this song is very different from the <a href="http://bawlipoonch.github.io/2016/01/26/hame-kaash-tumse-mohabbat-na-hoti/" target="_blank">hameskaash tumse mohabbat no hoti</a>. The time for regrets is in past. We are in the endgame. Emperor has demanded she renounce her love. Her beloved accused her of betrayal. Her rival is celebrating her downfall. And Anarkali? She has staked her all in one last throw of dice – a public avowal of her love, and a call of defiance – a song that became the anthem for doomed love forever. The blazing glances, the swirls, the presenting the dagger to the Emperor… defiance has never been so beautiful!

<i>Chhup naa sakega ishq hamara, Charo taraf hain unka nazara</i><br>
<i>Parda nahin jab koi khuda se, Bando se pardaa karnaa kyaa</i><br>

Happy Birthday Madhubala!

Philosophy is

<p> <b>Hai apna dil to awara</b> <br/>
Here is very young Dev saab telling you that his heart is vangabond; it has never found a place to dwell. Fawned upon by beautiful females but at heart he is a nomad.
</p>
<p><i>
haseeeno nai bulaya, gale se bhi lagaya<br/>
bahut samjhaya yahi na samjha<br/>
bahut bhola hai bechara na jane kispe aayega<br/>
</i>
</p>

<p>
Although he has been willing to fall in love, but circumstances were never in his favor.
</p>
<i>
Zamana dekha saara, hai sabka sahara, ye dil hamara hua na kisika <br/>
Safar mai hai ye banjara, na jane kispe aayega
</i>
<p><i>
hua jo kabhi razi to mila nahi qazi, <br/>
jaha pe lagi baazi wahi pe hara <br/>
zamane bhar ka nakara na jane kispe aayega <br/>
</i></p>

This was Dev Anand with his charming mischievous best with his endearing gap-toothed grin.

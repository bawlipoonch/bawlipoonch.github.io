	To me, Love defies logic. It defies reason too. It's illogical, unmechanical indefinable. Perhaps that's the attraction of it. that's what make it beautiful. But Love can hurt too. 
  That's the dark side of it. A wrong twist of fate, and you are left with a broken heart. 
<p/>

<p>
 My first song in this list is about the a love story which was doomed from the day one. 
 She is a courtasan in Mughal court and He is the crowned prince. Both knows their story wont have a happy ending, more the lady than the guy. 
 Although the calamity is yet to strick but the lady's heart is breaking over the impending diaster.

<b>the ache, the regret, if only .. </b>
<p>
<i>
Hamen kaash tumse mohabbat na hoti <br/>
Kahaani hamaari haqeeqat na hoti<br/>
Na dil tum ko dete na majboor hote <br/>
Na duniya na duniya ke dastoor hote<br/>
Qayamat se pahle qayamat na hoti<br/>
Hamein kaash tumse mohabbat na hoti<br/>
</i>
<br/>
I wish that I was never in love with you<br/> 
then my story wouldn't be the truth<br/>
Neither would I have given my heart to you nor would I be compelled<br/>
there wouldn't be the conventions of the world<br/>
there wouldn't be this disaster before the actual disaster<br/>
I wish that i was never in love with You<br/>
<p/>

<b>then she acknowledges her part </b>
<p>
<i>
Hum hi badh gaye ishq mein hadd se aage<br/>
Zamaane ne thokar lagaayi to jaage<br/>
Agar mar bhi jaate to hairat naa hoti<br/>
Hamein kaash tumse mohabbat na hoti<br/>
</i>
<br/>
I crossed the lines in love by my own will<br/>
When the world crashed into me, then I awoke<br/>
I wouldn't have been surprised even if I would've died<br/>
I wish that I was never in love with You<br/>
<p/>

<b>then gently complains if only he had not lead her impossible hopes </b>
<p>
<i>
Tumhi phoonk dete nasheman hamaare<br/>
Muhabbat pe ehsaan hota tumhaara<br/>
Zamaane se koyi shikaayat na hoti<br/>
Hamen kaash tumse mohabbat na hoti<br/>
</i>
<br/>
Only if you had snuffed out the flicker of my love <br/>
That would had been your greatest kindness on my love <br/>
There wouldn't be any complaints from the world<br/>
I wish that I was never in love with You<br/>
</i>

  Penned by Shakeel Badayuni, this is perhaps my favorite heartbreak song. I have been accused that my list of heartbreak songs comprises only songs 
  like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOfFbcodwHY" target="_blank">"apun jaise tapori ko kya maloom pyaar kis chidiya ka naam hai"</a>. 
  Not that i dont like that song. but it dont feature in my favorite list. Just thought to make it clear :)

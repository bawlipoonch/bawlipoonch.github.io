  Now that i have started writing about music more frequently, it was inevitable that i will talk about ghazals close to my heart. 
  And nothing seems more apt than this gem from Qateel Shifai, immortalized by Mehdi Hasan saab as first entry. <br/>
  Its a humble cry from the soul of a lover, a cry of devotion, a cry of eternal gratitude that he found her in this lifetime. 
</p>
<p>
<i>
zindagi mein to sabhi pyaar kiya karte hain<br/>
main to markar bhi meri jaan tujhe chahoonga<br/>
</i>
<br/>
Everyone loves someone in this lifetime 
i will love even from my dead
</p>

<p>
<i>
tu mila hai to ye ehsaas huaa hai mujhko<br/>
ye meri umr mohabbat ke liye thhodi hai<br/>
ek zara sa ghum-e-dauraan ka bhi haq hai jis par<br/>
maine wo saans bhi tere liye rakh chhodi hai<br/>
</i>
<br/>
Ever since I have met you, I have felt that this long life seems too little for love <br/>
Every last breath that i have in this sorrowful world, i have devoted it to you.
</p>

<p>
<i>
apne jazbaat mein naghmaat rachaane ke liye <br/>
maine dhadkan ki tarah dil mein basaaya hai tujhe<br/>
<b>main tasavvur bhi judaai ka bhala kaise karoon?<br/>
maine kismat ki lakeeron se churaaya hai tujhe<br/></b>
pyar ka banke nigehbaan tujhe chaahoonga<br/>
</i>
<br/>
<br/>
To express my emotions through my songs, i have poured you into my heart like its heartbeat<br/>
How can i even imagine to be separated from you when i have found you after fighting the fate, this couplet is my favorite. Just two lines but have meaning so deep. the struggle of finding love and pain mere thought of separation brings.<br/>
like a true caretaker of our love, I will always love you.  
</p>

<p>
<i>
teri har chaap se jalte hain khayaalon mein chiraag<br/>
jab bhi tu aaye jagaata huaa jaadu aaye<br/>
tujhko chhulun to aye jaan-e-tamanna mujhko<br/>
dair tak apne badan se teri khushboo aaye<br/>
tu bahaaron ka hai unwaan tujhe chaahoonga<br/>
</i>

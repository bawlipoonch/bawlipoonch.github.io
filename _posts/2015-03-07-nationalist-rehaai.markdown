<p> In December 1989, JKLF terrorist Mushtaq Zargar kidnapped Mufti Sayeed's daughter and got 5 hardcore terrorists released. 
With BJP's outside support VP Singh and Mufti Mohammad Saeed paved the way for terrorist release against intelligence agencies' advice. 
It galvanised militancy in kashmir. </p> 
<p> Cut to 1999: The BJP paves way for the release of Mushtaq Zargar along with Omar Sheikh and Masood Azhar.
Zargar plans several big attacks on Indian soil from Pakistan. Sheikh slaughters Daniel Pearl and Azhar coordinates terrorists activities of Jaish-e-Mohammed. </p> 
<p> Cut to 2015: BJP and newly turned-nationalist Mufti Mohammad Saeed, now with full majority, paves way for release of radical guy Masrat Alam. Hizbul terrorist Fakhtoo may be next.
Several times in the past, Hizbul and United Jihad Council chief Syed Salahudin has lauded the roles of Alam and Fakhtoo. </p> 
<p>So, Bhakt janon, Masrat Alam is free. Others will be , too. Yeh kaisi nationalist party hai ? Chullu bhar paani mai du ya tum khud jugaad loge ? </p>

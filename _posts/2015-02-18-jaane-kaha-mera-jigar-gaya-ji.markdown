 I love this song, simply and utterly love it. Johnny Walker is hilarious and his pretty dimpled girlfriend 
 is a delight. Together they sing the cutest song. Dancing around deserted office during lunch hour, teasing each other and crawling on floor under the table.
 Who will not be amused by the cute antics of these love birds ?
 This is a delightful couple to watch. A dream pair everyone would love to be and grow old teasing each other even when they are grandparents

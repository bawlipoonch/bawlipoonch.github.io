 I love this song, simply and utterly love it. Johnny Walker is hilarious, his girlfriend 
 (played by the very pretty dimpled Yasmin) is a delight, and together they sing one of the cutest love songs. 
 They dance around an office deserted for lunch and end up crawling along the floor under the desks,
 I can’t help but grin at the antics of the two. 
 This couple that’s probably going to continue to tease each other and play pranks even when they’re grandparents.

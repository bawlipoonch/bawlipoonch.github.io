Just watched the ```Logan``` trailor and I am blown away with the settings of the movie. I have always been fan of dark and gritty superhero(or heroines, Wonderwoman i am so eagerly waiting for you) movies. So i liked the background rundown setup in Mexican desert, very honest depiction of misery. Logan, whose regenerative &healing powers have kept him fit for almost two centuries, is an old and very broken down man.  He is filthy, gets his ass kicked a lot, drives an busted car, and lives in a rusted out building. This guy has seen some shit, and itâ€™s taken a toll on him. When he fights, it largely does not go well. The trailor does gives away his fate & this is going to be be his last hurray as Wolverine. And it looks epic, i am glad its not like previous al the same all the same x-men movies.

`As for our hero, well, he's older now and it's clear his abilities aren't what they were once. He's fading on the inside and his diminished healing factor keeps him in a constant state of chronic pain -- hence booze as painkiller.`

`So by all means, go ahead and worry about him.`

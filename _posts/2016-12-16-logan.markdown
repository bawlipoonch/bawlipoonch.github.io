Just watched the `Logan` trailor and I am blown away with the settings of the movie. I have always been fan of dark and gritty superhero(or heroines, Wonderwoman i am so eagerly waiting for you) movies. So no surpise i liked the background rundown setup in Mexican desert with rusty towers, dirt and forest, very honest depiction of misery. Logan, whose regenerative & healing powers have kept him fit for almost 150 years, is an old and very broken down man.  He is filthy, gets his ass kicked a lot, drives an busted car, and lives in a rusted out building. This guy has seen some shit, and itâ€™s taken a toll on him. When he fights, it largely does not go well. Movie promises to be violent and Logan will be covered in his enemies blood by the climax, but he deserves this as his farewell. The trailor also gives away his fate & this is going to be be his last hurray as Wolverine.

Also using haunting `hurt` which exemplifies feeling of suicidal depression as background score to show Logan's soul crushing depressive state is marvellous. It sets the tone of entire trailor.

From the screenplay of Logan, `As for our hero, well, he's older now and it's clear his abilities aren't what they were once. He's fading on the inside and his diminished healing factor keeps him in a constant state of chronic pain -- hence booze as painkiller.`

`So by all means, go ahead and worry about him.`

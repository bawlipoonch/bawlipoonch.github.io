<i>  
Yes, and how many ears must one man have<br/>
Before he can hear people cry?<br/>
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows<br/>
That too many people have died?<br/>
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind<br/>
The answer is blowing in the wind<br/>

This song by Bob Dylan takes a aim at the USA foreign policy during the Cold War which ultimately lead to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. 
During the war more and more troops were repeatedly sent in with the promise that the war would end soon, but it seemed to never cease. 
Dylan poses a challenge that If we don’t do the right thing, there’s going to be a war in the streets. In retrospect, the U.S. Civil Rights Movement really did come to that.

<span class="caption text-muted">Bob dylan's spiritual 'blowing in the wind' which is described as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowin%27_in_the_Wind">impenetrably ambiguous: either the answer is so obvious it is right in your face, or the answer is as intangible as the wind</a>.</span>

Batman is by far my favorite super hero. He has got principles (the Rich Shashi 'uff tumhare yeh ussol, tumhare yeh adarsh' Kapoor of Deewar) and moral dilemma. He is super rich billionire and still vulnerable. He has a emotional depth and grounded abilities that makes him the hero i can relate to. To top that he has the best rogue gallery in be it anarchist like Joker, Bane, Ra's al Ghul or Mob Bosses like Falcone, Carmine or Two-face, Penguin, Riddler. In short, IMHO He is the rich street-level detective who has main strength in mental deduction and moral principles.  

But its getting tough for him to thrive in a world full of aliens or meta-humans who descends from the sky and create havoc in Gotham City. I have a feeling that this will continue to become more apparent as Justice League takes more formal shape. His arsenal from his belt cannot match the God-like power that his team mates wield. And Batman will be relegated to a non playing captain role. And that would be sad.

<p> 
  And that's my brother!
</p>
<p>
Yesterday he got campus hire offer from <a href="http://snapdeal.com" target="_blank">Snapdeal</a> and I am proud. 
  As his elder brother i feel responsible to give him some advice at this important juncture of his life. This comes from my own pages of life.
</p>

  You'll be happy to be best at something you love doing. find that thing and do it with passion. But as years roll on, you will change so will your love. be adaptable. 
  To paraphrase Jeff Bezos, be stubborn on your vision, flexible on details.  
</p>  
<p>
There's some sort of misplaced humility that is injected into us by our educational system. 
Or maybe it is some sort social stigma attached to the braggart or overacheiver. 
Same thing must be going through Lennon's mind when he penned <i>"they'll hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool"</i>. 
You will struggle to stand out and the pressures to blend in, find some sort of balance with your inner self. 
</p>
<p>
So you are the real deal. To start off your career, you dive in and start pulling your weight. 
But even a moron in a hurry can see that what you're doing is <del>valuable</del> essential to the company. 
You keep working, in your little corner. Nobody notices anything and if they do, it's when you fail. 
You complain about not being noticed to your peers, you rant about how your life sucks.<br/>
Just getting your work done is not enough. You need to show off that as well. 
Communication is single most important piece in career progression. 
If i can go back and fix one thing about my whole career, it will be my poor communication skills. 
Your manager should know what happened, did not happened, is happening and will happen.
Obviously, your management wants to know that, it's exactly the kind of information they crave. When it's handed to them in a platter, they love it. <br/>
</p>
<p>
Also, You don't need to be a 'Yes Man' or a sychophant to get your manager to treat you well. 
All you need to do is to make his job easier ... after all, managing you is pretty hard work. 
</p>

Congratulations once again. And to wake you up to the harsh realities of your incoming life, Ghalib said.

Ghalib you are now a salaried man, bless the King,<br/>
Those days are no more when you said you are nobody’s servant

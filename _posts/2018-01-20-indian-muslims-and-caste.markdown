`bulleh nu samjhawan aaiyaann bhaena tey bharjayee-yan` <br/>
`man lay bulleya sada kena, chad day palla raaiyan `

_Bulleh Shah’s sisters and sisters-in-laws came to convince him. <br/>
Bulleya, please do as we tell you and leave the Arain’s (his guru’s) company._

`aal e nabi ullad e ali, nu tu kyun lee-kaan laiyaan.` 

_you are born into the family of prophet, you are heir of ali,_<br/>
_so why do you ruin your family’s name like this._

`jeyra saanoun syed saday dozakh milay sazaiyaan.`<br/>
`jo koi saanu raie aakhe, bhisti peenghaan paian.`

_those who address me as syed, shall be condemned to hell._<br/>
_those who address me as raie, shall ride the swings in heaven._


`raien, saayin, sabhin thaayein, rab deyaan bay parwaaiyaan,`<br/>
`sohniyaan paray hatayaan tay, khojeyaan lay gall laiyaan.`

_arain and masters are born at every place, god does not discriminate against anyone,_<br/>
_the lord is so carefree, that he neglects the beautiful (others) and hugs the ugly._


`jay to lorain baagh baharaan ,chaakar ho ja araiyaan.` <br/>
`bulley shah dee zaat kee puchni, shaakar ho razayaan.`

_if you seek the pleasure of a heaven in spring, go and become a servant of the araiens,_<br/>
_o’ do not ask bullah his caste; be thankful and be content with the lord’s creation._

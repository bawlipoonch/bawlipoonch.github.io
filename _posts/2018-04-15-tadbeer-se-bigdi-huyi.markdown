I have been writing posts about songs for different moods on this blog. One recurring theme in Bollywood songs is philosophical. Some of them are close to me at personal level as a guiding light how i (or should) live my life. Many of them were introduced to me by my father just like other numerous life lessons he handed to me.

Warning: this list is going to be a string of song tributes to Sahir Ludhyanvi, the fatalist poet of modern India and Dev Anand saab just like my other lists :D

For someone whose life is string of failures with dotted success at the right moments just by sheer luck, this one is special song. The deep meaning Sahir convey is <i>if your life is not turning out as you planned don't despair and lose hope, throw the caution in air a bit and take a gambit. It is up to you to do what you will with your life.</i>. This song was so typical of Dev saab's philosophy in real life. Ever the gambler, he continued to make films one after the other till he died, irrespective of their fate at the box office.

<i>tadbeer se bigdi huyi taqdeer banaa le,taqdeer banaa le</i><br>
<i>apne pe bharosaa hai to ye daanv lagaa le, lagaa le daanv lagaa le</i><br>
</p>

What if cautiously led out plans are not going as thought, create your own fate<br>
if you have faith in yourself, take a gamble on yourself.<br>

<p>
<i>kyaa khaakh wo jeenaa hai jo apne hi liye ho, apne hi liye ho</i><br>
<i>khud mitke kisi aur ko mitne se bachaa le, mitne se bachaa le</i><br>
</p>

this life is not worth living if you lived it just for yourself.<br>
learn to help others and make sacrifices to save your loved ones.<br>

<p>
<i>toote huye patwaar hain kashti ke to ham kyaa aaa,</i><br>
<i>haari huyi baahon ko hi patwaar banaa le, patwaar banaa le</i><br>
<i>apne pe bharosaa hai to ye daanv lagaa le, lagaa le daanv lagaa le</i><br>
</p>

What if the boat is rudderless with the broken paddles,<br>
row the boat through your defeated arms,<br>
if you have faith in yourself, take a gamble on yourself.<br>

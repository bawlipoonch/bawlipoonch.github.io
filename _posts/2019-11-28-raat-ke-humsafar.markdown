I love, love, love this song. It is perfect, enticingly romantic. what better way to celebrate a love than to walk hand in hand with your lover around the city of love, under the light of the stars and a benevolent moon. And still can be interpreted as very mundane life. The smouldering look that a man gives gives to his wife when she steps down from last bus and then they walk back to their home hand in hand while wife recounts her day at work. 

Such a romantic, intoxicating night, and two happy people. 

Picturised in Paris, with Shammi Kapoor. And Sharmila Tagore. Mohammed Rafi singing for Shammi in just that way that was uniquely Shammi. Asha Bhosle at her sensuous best. And  What more can one ask for?  


<i>Raat ne pyar ke jaam bhar kar diye</i><br/>
<i>Aankhon aankhon se jo maine tumne piye</i><br/>
<i>Hosh toh ab talaq jaake laute nahin</i><br/>
<i>Aur kya laa rahi hai subha pyaar ki</i><br/>

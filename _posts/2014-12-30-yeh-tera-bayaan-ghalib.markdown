<p> 
<i>Yeh Masail-e-Tasawwuf..Yeh tera bayaan Ghalib,</i><br/>
<i>Tujhe hum wali samajhte, jo na baadakhwaar hota</i>
</p>
<p>
Masail – topic or subject of discussion;<br/> 
tasawwuf – philosophy, mysticism;<br/> 
Wali – A saint, friend of God;<br/> 
Baadakhwar – someone who drinks alcohol
</p>
<p>
In the couplet Ghalib is telling himself that the way you (Ghalib) talk of philosophy..
the mystical way in which you explain it..You would have been considered saint himself…If only you did not drink so much.

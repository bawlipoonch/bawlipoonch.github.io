<p> This song keeps haunting me day and night. I wish someone had told me earlier. I learnt my lesson the hard way. 
    Actually, i am learning my lesson the hard way. I had quite forgotten that i cant be everything i want to be before my time. 
    I was so caught up with it, so ahead of myself, that i had forgotten what i need. 
<p> I am making an effort now though. Now, whenever i feel that i have so much to do and only so little time i tell myself to slow down. But then, the idiot that i am, 
  I don't listen to myself all the time either. Atleast now i know that life is waiting for me. Patiently, hoping that i will atleast learn the truth, the hard way. </p>

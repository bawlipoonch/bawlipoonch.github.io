<p>I'd never heard of Caithlyn Seihl and now i'll never forget.<p>
<i>
Do not fall in love with people like me <br/>
we will take you to<br/>
museums and parks<br/>
and monuments<br/>
and kiss you in every beautiful<br/>
place so that you can<br/>
never go back to them<br/>
without tasting us<br/>
like blood in your mouth<br/>
I will destroy you in most beautiful way possible<br/>
And when i leave<br/>
you will finally understand,<br/>
why storms are named after people.<br/>

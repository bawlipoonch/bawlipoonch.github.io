  Not really a patriotic songs per se. Singer is not aspiring to die for his country or kill for it.
  But still it shows the longing for the mother land by a man living in another country.
  Salil tripathi's bare minimum music, Balraj Sahini's color bereft face and Manne dey's poignant voice combines into a goosebumpy experience, that it is difficult to hold tears back. <br>
  It is ironic that the singer (in the film) is not an Indian; the land he is longing for is not India, it is Kabul. 
  He is a Afghani Pathan, and he longs for the smell of his native soil, the winds whisper its name to him; it's his life and his honour, 
  and the memories are almost too much for him to bear. And his dearest wish is that he can go back there one day, back to the land where he was born.

  Chod kar teri jamee ko duur aa pahunche hai hum<br/> 
  Phir bhi hai yehi tammana tere zarro ki kasam<br/> 
  Hum jahan paide huye<br/>
  Us jagah hi nikle dam<br/> 
  Tujh pe dil qurbaan<br/>

<p> 
	On 16 december 2014, Seven terrorists killed 138 people including 132 children. I refuse to count 7 terrorists as human death. This was one of the most dastardly terror attack in the long list of such crimes. I was shocked and saddened with whole event. A mere condemnation of perpetrators sounded so hollow for the act. So i kept my silence, while people of Pakistan mourned for the loss of hundreds of dream and humanity.

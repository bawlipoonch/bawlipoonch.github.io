<p> 
	On 16 december 2014, Seven terrorists killed 138 people (I refuse to count 7 terrorists as human death.) including 132 children. 
  This was one of the most dastardly terror attack in the long list of such crimes. I was shocked and saddened with whole event. 
  A mere condemnation of perpetrators sounded so hollow for the act. So i kept my silence, while people of Pakistan mourned for the 
  loss of hundreds of dream and humanity. And <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/trending/indiawithpakistan-when-countries-united-on-twitter/article6700010.ece"> 
  India stood by them in their grief</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  Pakistan Prime minister rightly pledged a war on terrorism and he did took some decisive steps in that direction with lifting ban on death penalty to hang 3000 convicts asap.
  Pakistan also increased drone strikes in Taliban hideouts in FATA. I cannot feel this being a knee-jerk reaction and mob justice but I hope Pakistan continues 
  and make taliban shit in their pants. 
</p>
But its not enough. 
<li>
    A full blown propanganda factory (with Hafeez Saeed as its CEO) is running to venom against India. That should be silenced. 
    Pakistan should also stop using Taliban as asset in fighting with India.

  <li> Extremist taliban has lot of sympathy in each quarter. 
    This <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1152382">hypocrisy of good taliban and bad taliban</a> thing needs to be killed. 
    People openly shows support to Taliban and nothing happens to them. For example, Arshad Mehmood hanged as a terrorist few days back but buried as a hero. 
    This mindset, the cancer, has badly affected. Until we all stop sympathizing with the them, there will remain a fertile ground for our young generation to be brain washed into it.

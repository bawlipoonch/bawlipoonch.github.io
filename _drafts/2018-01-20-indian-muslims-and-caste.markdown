Castes don't exists in Muslims is a lie peddled for too long by Indian Ashraf Muslims. Let me quote the shining example of Muslim liberal, Syed Ahmad Khan's speech.

``


This single piece of work by Bulley Shah demolish several myths that are perperated by Ashraf scholars. 

* Caste is a colonian construct. 
* That Muslim caste is a colonian construct.
* That Shaikh/Syed do not have *Brahminical* position in muslim society.

Indian Muslims have almost identical replica of caste structure as Hindus based on profession. What amuses me most is that people living in most remote part of the country claims to be direct descendent of Prophet Mohammad. Always gives me chuckle.  

`bulleh nu samjhawan aaiyaann bhaena tey bharjayee-yan` <br/>
`man lay bulleya sada kena, chad day palla raaiyan `

_Bulleh Shah’s sisters and sisters-in-laws came to convince him. <br/>
Bulleya, please do as we tell you and leave the Arain’s (his guru’s) company._

`aal e nabi ullad e ali, nu tu kyun lee-kaan laiyaan.` 

_you are born into the family of prophet, you are heir of ali,_<br/>
_so why do you ruin your family’s name like this._

`jeyra saanoun syed saday dozakh milay sazaiyaan.`<br/>
`jo koi saanu raie aakhe, bhisti peenghaan paian.`

_those who address me as syed, shall be condemned to hell._<br/>
_those who address me as raie, shall ride the swings in heaven._

`raien, saayin, sabhin thaayein, rab deyaan bay parwaaiyaan,`<br/>
`sohniyaan paray hatayaan tay, khojeyaan lay gall laiyaan.`

_arain and masters are born at every place, god does not discriminate against anyone,_<br/>
_the lord is so carefree, that he neglects the beautiful (others) and hugs the ugly._


`jay to lorain baagh baharaan ,chaakar ho ja araiyaan.` <br/>
`bulley shah dee zaat kee puchni, shaakar ho razayaan.`

_if you seek the pleasure of a heaven in spring, go and become a servant of the araiens,_<br/>
_o’ do not ask bullah his caste; be thankful and be content with the lord’s creation._

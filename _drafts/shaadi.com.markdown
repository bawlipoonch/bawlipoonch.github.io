This is regarding your daughter Zoha's shaadi.com profile. I really liked her profile as she is super talented and . 
So i expressed my interest in possibility of you considering my proposal for her. 
I am a honest and decent person who is easy to live with and passionate about career and many things in life. 
To know more about me, please feel free to check my professional profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/hackerasif 
Also, my personal blog bawlipoonch.github.io reflects my personality and opinions.

Hoping to listen from you favorably.

Allah Hafiz,

Assalamu alaikum,

I sent you a interest request for your daughter's profile on shaadi.com. I know its really hard for a parent to decide if a guy is right for his/her daughter or not.
So i wanted to make a pitch for myself to make your decision easier. I am yet another software engineer, not really super-talented, but i get the work done. 
love my job and am respected in my professional circle. Ambitious and wants to find out if 10x engineer really exists or its a gangland myth.
Career trajectory is here https://www.linkedin.com/in/hackerasif
But I am much better person than engineer. honest, ethical and fair. 
(I would love to quote Two Face from The Dark Knight, "Unbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair". but no, i am biased and prejudiced, learning how not to)
I am well read and opinionated on different topics. My blog reflects my opinions and personality much better http://bawlipoonch.github.io 
My friends & family can give you a more biased version if you want. https://www.facebook.com/hackerasif

I have not really thought of what kind of life partner i really want, but i will choose a intelligent, witty and successful girl anyday and twice on sunday. But i am adaptable. 
Your daughter is really intelligent. Economics is my new favorite because of geo-politics reading i have been doing and 
stats scares the hell out of me (i often have 1:1 with machine learning in my day job). So easy for me to understand, eco. grads means intelligent.
So its natural i find her attractive.
As a partner, i hope to be everything i think of myself fair, patient and not-MCP.

From the profile, it is quite apparent that your family in general and daughter in specific is very talented. 
I cannot even fathom about sitting in IAS (okay i am lying, i did aspired once due to peer pressure but love my computer too much to try anything else), let alone exceling it. Thats really amazing.
As a partner, i hope to be everything i think of myself fair, patient and not-MCP.   


If you think i may fit in your daughter's design of life-partner. Do consider my proposal.

PS: In normal life, not this narsissist and do not mention "I" these many times in a day. But making exceptions is day job for software guys.

I liked your daughter's profile, She being a doctor automatically means intelligent and hard working, two qualities which are deal making qualities for me. 
I understand me being in US can be a issue but i am willing to be as supportive as needed.

Management grad and wrking as finance specialist in bank tells the story. 
She is engineer too. Did i told you, engineers loves engineers ?
She is also from kanpur, my second home city. what is not to like about her
So its natural i find her attractive. Also she is beautiful in her profile pictures.

A herd will either choose a lion or a Jesus as their leader, jesus is hard to come by, so more often than not they end up choosing a lion. There is a third possibility, they choose one of the sheep to lead them. But all sheeps look and behave the same, so becomes very difficult for them to choose one of them as  their leader. Also, sheeps doesn’t know their way, they need someone from outside to guide them,lead them.

Among Lions,few learn modern art of hunting. They get into costumes of sheep and start pretending to be one of the sheeps..Naive sheeps doesn’t realize it, lion in sheep costume induces them with fear of lion, shows them that only he got the muscle to fight in event of an attack and convinces them to make him their leader. Sheeps believe him,choose him to lead..Lion feasts on them…Sheeps realize their mistake.Tries to correct, another lion in sheep’s costume convinces them to make  him their leader, sheeps get fooled again.

There aren’t many Jesus around. Even if there are few who are closer to Jesus, they are content with themselves. They won’t mind leading but they won’t come forward, at times cause it hurts their ego,at times cause they are not in trouble so they  dont care.And when they do come forward, lions among sheep convinces the herd that he is even worse than lion.

Sheeps should come forward, not to choose just another sheep, not to choose  lion in sheep costume but to convince the Jesus to lead them.
